# EnergiPris
Calculates the Norwegian Electricity Price including 'network rental fee' and electricity subsidies ("strømstøtte"). Will also list the 0-point, e.g. the limit for when you will actually earn money by using electricity.

The function calculates the current 'network rental cost' from time of day, day of week and current month (can be overridden). The different prices is based upon my local energy supplier, but should be pretty similar as it is set by our national authority.

The different parameters are in Norwegian, as this is very specific for the current Norwegian model of electricity subsidies.
